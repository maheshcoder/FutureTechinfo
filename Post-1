<p><strong>Subjects had the chance to go face-to-face with their future selves.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Researchers at the Indiana University School of Medicine conducted a study recently showing how VR technology could be used to help those suffering from substance abuse. First reported by&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/local/new-vr-technology-iu-aims-improve-substance-abuse/531-2d359cbc-3d84-41cc-ad60-cb257ec2fb0b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">13WTHR</a></strong>, the study involved 21 adults in early substance use disorder (SUD) recovery using VR technology to communicate with different variations of their future selves.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sustained remission from substance use disorder (SUD) is challenged by high relapse rates, which provides opportunities for novel clinical interventions,” said the team in the study. “Immersive virtual reality (VR) permits delivering synthetic experiences that feel real and actualizes otherwise impossible scenarios for therapeutic benefit.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Participants were presented with two versions of themselves age-progressed by 15 years: SUD Future Self and a Recovery Future Self. Each avatar featured personalized voices and delivered interactive monologues personalized to each subject. Following their VR conversations, participants were sent images of their&nbsp;Recovery Future Selves on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Of the 21 participants who received VR treatment, 18 remained sober for at least a 30-day period.</p>

<p>“The current study demonstrates an implementation readily applied in the clinic and shows promise for facilitating SUD recovery. Creative collaboration between researchers, clinicians, and VR developers has great potential to revolutionize mental health interventions and expand the range of tools for clinicians targeting SUD and other disorders.”</p>

<p>The short-term outlook for virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) may be a struggle, according to Strategy Analytics, but if organisations can ride out this wave then the future looks bright.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The findings appear in the analyst firm’s latest report, ‘Short and Long-Term Impacts of Covid-19 on the AR and VR Market.’ Among the report’s key takeaways are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>XR hardware revenues will overtake $28 billion annually in 2025</li><li>Total XR shipments – combined VR and dedicated AR headsets – will increase sixfold through 2025</li><li>2021 and 2022 will see a ‘slight comeback’ for smartphone-tethered VR headsets due to the rise of 5G networks</li></ul>

<p>Strategy sees 2020 as ‘the year that the market for dedicated AR headsets [could have] really taken off’.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic forced more urgent priorities for organisations, chiefly around enabling remote working and bolstering cloud infrastructure. Yet this ‘new normal’ will help the AR and VR markets going forward, the analyst firm added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Covid-19 will have a significantly negative effect on the market for XR in 2020,” the company said in a note. “We anticipate both shipments and revenues declining by just over 20% y/o/y. We expect that the launch of smartphone-tethered AR headsets is likely to be pushed back to at least the very end of 2020, if not 2021, effectively delaying our earlier anticipated growth in a consumer market for dedicated AR devices by a year.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One area of potential growth going forward is in lightweight, consumer-friendly AR headsets. Once smartphone-tethered devices reach the market, these devices will be commercialised, with Samsung and Nreal cited as leading the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Strategy added that fully immersive 3D environments are beginning to bear fruit in design, in particular engineering, automotive and architecture, as well as in training and education for VR devices. “We have raised our longer term forecast for XR hardware as a result of new work and life patterns in the new normal,” said David MacQueen, director of the virtual and augmented reality service at Strategy Analytics. “Work at home, training, education, and collaboration will all benefit from AR/VR.”</p>

<p>This is not the only analyst note arguing for cautious optimism.&nbsp;<a href="https://virtualreality-news.net/news/2019/dec/04/virtual-and-augmented-reality-market-volatile-promising-warns-ccs-insight/">In December</a>&nbsp;– albeit prior to the pandemic – CCS Insight posited that the VR and AR markets were volatile, but promising. The market for extended reality products was set to see a growth of 21% in 2019.</p>
